    <p>My name is Hacene OUSLIMANI. I'm a student at <em>Algonquin college</em>, and my program is <mark><abbr title="Interactive Media Design"> IMD</abbr></mark>. I enjoy staying productive and challenging myself in different ways, especially through personal development and learning. I like setting goals and working toward them step by step, because progress, even small, makes me feel motivated and confident.</p>
    <p>Outside of my daily routine, I focus on building positive habits and staying consistent with my efforts. I believe success comes from <strong>discipline</strong>, <strong>patience</strong>, and a willingness to learn from mistakes. Every day is an opportunity to grow, and I try to make the most of it by pushing myself to become better and the 1<sup>st</sup> between my friends.</p>
